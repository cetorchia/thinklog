<h2>About Thinklog</h2>

<p>Thinklog is intended to be a tool for helping you analyze your thoughts
and the thoughts of others. Every day many of us enter a lot of data into
social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, such as what we do, where we
work, and who we know. However, is this data helping us?
Why not put this data to work, <i>for you</i>?</p>

<p>The aim of Thinklog is to provide you with insights about thoughts that you enter
into Thinklog, and thoughts that are out there on the web. You can enter your thoughts
as they arise in your mind, or you can tell Thinklog to fetch RSS feeds or Twitter
content. Thinklog processes this content so it can provide you with relevant keywords and
recommended thoughts. The goal is to show how your thoughts relate to the thoughts of
others and vice-versa, and to show trends in your personal experience.</p>

<p>Rather than being locked away in "social networking silos", useful insights into
our own data can be open to the world, creating opportunity for growth for a wide range
of businesses, communities, and individuals.</p>
